THE PROBLEM
“There are many who want to donate to worthy causes, but don’t know how to. They want to be sure they are helping the right people. When it comes to money, there is a lack of trust.”
The work carried out by charities and voluntary organisations is invaluable to society, helping people in the greatest need both in INDIA and abroad. Charities rely on donations from the general public and businesses to carry out their work, especially in tough economic times. Most collections and appeals are authentic and legitimate, but unfortunately fraudsters can exploit people’s charitable nature and steal money which the donor thinks is going to help the charity. One of the most common ways of doing this is online.. Charity scammers use deception to steal money. Scam artists often exploit natural disasters and other emergencies to play with donors' sympathy and take advantage of their generosity. The internet is rife with all manner of scams and hoaxes, many of them preying on people’s willingness or desire to donate to charities. Whether it’s via a fraudulent website, a fake story on a legitimate site.Hurricane Katrina  Services Fund:, Japan  Relief Scams,National VeteransScams are examples of some of the biggest scams.

CURRENT SOLUTIONS
The current solutions are more or less user dependent.They have to verify the credentials of organisation themselves, or sometimes have to visit it,which is a tedious task .And hence many of donors hesitate to donate for noble causes.

OUR IDEA
Our idea is to build a blockchain based  donation website where organisations asking for donations are verified .Each individual’s donation data will be housed securely ,which noone can edit .Each transaction on the network will be public which will provide transparency in the process.


THE UNIQUE FEATURES:-
* Transparency :
 As the blockchain can provide transparency, the world would be able to discover the transactions happened on the network.
* Traceability:
 Blockchain enabled applications can trace the authenticity of donations and organisations from the start till the present and in future as well. It will prevent the frauds
* .Immutable Approach: 
  Blockchain is immutable as they cannot be altered, changed or deleted. Hence donors are well ensured about the service

Ways to host your project on the localhost:

* install the metamask extension for google chrome
* Clone this directory using git clone
* Install packages using npm install
* Start the Frontend Server using npm run dev
* The site can be seen on localhost:3000


What all can it currently do?
* A person can connect to Metamask to browse the site
* Any user can submit their donations
